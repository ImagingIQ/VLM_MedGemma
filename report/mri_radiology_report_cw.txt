Overall MRI Scan Analysis:
**Overall Radiology Report - T2-Weighted MRI Brain Scan**

**Summary of Findings**:

* **Anatomical Regions Examined:** Cerebral hemispheres (frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital lobes), Cerebellum, Brainstem (pons, midbrain), Ventricles (lateral, third, fourth), White matter, Gray matter, Basal ganglia, Thalamus, Optic nerves/chiasm, Internal carotid/vertebral arteries, Globus Pallidus.
* **Significant Abnormalities:**

    * **Tumor (Right Temporal/Frontal Lobe):** Multiple lesions identified. Largest measures approximately 35mm (Slice 18) and 40mm (Slice 19) in diameter. Located in the right temporal and frontal lobes. Hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging with significant mass effect, compressing the right temporal horn of the lateral ventricle (Slice 18). No necrosis or enhancement clearly visible on these slices.
    * **Tumor (Left Cerebellum):** A lesion approximately 15mm in diameter, located in the left cerebellum. Heterogeneous signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging. No significant mass effect or enhancement.
    * **Stroke (Pontine Infarct):** Evidence of a likely pontine infarct (Slice 6) with surrounding edema. Lesion approximately 7mm in diameter.
    * **Multiple Sclerosis/Demyelination:** Multiple small (3-7mm) hyperintense foci in the periventricular white matter (Slice 15) and scattered throughout the white matter (Slice 12), suggestive of possible demyelinating lesions or microvascular disease.
    * **Other (Globus Pallidus):** A well-defined, rounded lesion (approximately 18mm) with central hyperintensity in the globus pallidus (Slice 22), potentially representing a hemorrhage, cystic component, or vascular lesion.
    * **Other (Right Ventricle):** A small (20x15 pixels) hyperintense focus within the right ventricle (Slice 20), potentially representing a small chronic infarct or other process.
    * **Other (Right Parietal Lobe):** Multiple small lesions (5mm, 5mm, 1.5cm) identified in the right parietal lobe (Slices 13, 16, 17). Signal intensity varies, with some demonstrating mass effect.
    * **Stroke (Possible):** A small lesion in the left temporal lobe (Slice 2) measuring approximately 1.5cm in diameter with associated edema.

**Impression**:

Multiple abnormalities are identified throughout the brain. The large lesions in the right temporal and frontal lobes are concerning for neoplasm and require urgent further investigation. The cerebellar lesion, multiple white matter foci, and right parietal lobe lesions require further characterization to determine their etiology. The pontine infarct and right ventricular focus are likely chronic findings but should be correlated with clinical presentation. The globus pallidus lesion warrants further evaluation to rule out vascular pathology.

**Recommendations**:

Immediate contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain is recommended to further characterize the lesions, assess for enhancement patterns, and evaluate for potential mass effect and involvement of surrounding structures. Consideration should be given to neurosurgical consultation and/or biopsy for definitive diagnosis, particularly for the larger lesions. Clinical correlation with patient history and neurological examination is essential.
